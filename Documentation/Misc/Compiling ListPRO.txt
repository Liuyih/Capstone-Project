Compiling ListPRO:
VS2017 with these packages:
- Visual MFC for x86 and x64
  - Project is an MFC app, using CDialog and related GUI stuff
- Windows Universal CRT SDK
  - Project uses some C runtime stuff
- Visual C++ ATL for x86 and x64
  - I think this is used to control an Ortec COM component?

Code changes:
ListPRODlg.cpp
Change line 668: CreateFile argument 3, dwShareMode, from 0 to FILE_SHARE_READ

Project changes (necessary to bundle MFC and CRT stuff in .exe):
Configuration Properties -> General -> Use of MFC : Use MFC in a Static Library
Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Runtime Library : Multi-threaded (/MT)
- If Multi-threaded DLL (/MD) is picked, it won't bundle CRT by the looks of it
